\usage{
geodesic_MDS(
  tree_path,
  nf = 2,
  names = NULL,
  consensus = "consensus",
  mds_package = "ade4"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree_path}{The file path to a txt file containing phylogenetic trees in a multiPhylo object.}

\item{nf}{The number of axes in the MDS to keep.}

\item{mds_package}{The default is to run classical MDS using ade4. To change this to metric MDS using the
package smacof, use the argument mds_package = "smacof".}
}
\value{
A list containing an object 'dist_mat' containing geodesic distances between each phylogenetic tree
in the multiPhylo object, and an object 'df' containing the desired number of axes in the MDS of the trees.
